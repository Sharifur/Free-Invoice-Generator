Unlike invoices which request payment for completed work, quotations are sent before any work begins. They help businesses communicate pricing transparently and allow customers to compare offers from different suppliers.\n\nA professional quotation demonstrates your business credibility and sets clear expectations for both parties involved in the potential transaction. It's often the first formal document a potential client receives from your business, making it a crucial touchpoint in the customer journey."

For businesses, quotations serve as a sales tool that can highlight value propositions and competitive advantages.\n\nWell-designed quotations can increase conversion rates by up to 40% compared to verbal estimates or rough calculations. They provide a written record of what was offered, protecting both parties from future disputes and ensuring everyone is aligned on expectations before work begins."
